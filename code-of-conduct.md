# Code of Conduct

Melbourne C++ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious
beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the Melbourne C++ organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
for any Melbourne C++ event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are
expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the Melbourne C++ organizers may take any action they deem
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the Melbourne C++ community. If you are being harassed,
notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Melbourne C++ organizer
immediately.

who in turn used the Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its
